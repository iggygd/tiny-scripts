# tiny-scripts
Any scripts I make when I'm bored will be kept here.

It's usually for when I don't have access to my project folder and I really just have to code something. But at times, ideas will just pop into my head and I have to code them before it goes away.

If it has bugs... whoops. I might fix them eventually.
## neuralnets/
Currently just a repo for creating a fully connected neural net for different libraries (numpy, tensorflow, keras, theano, caffe, pytorch). Doesn't have to be Python.

## wstldterm/
Fallout-like Terminal, I just wanted to test out a terminal ui library. Really limited.

## procedural_world/
Generates shapes, with each shape connected to neighbouring tiles. Uses an opensimplex generated heightmap, so a heightmap input could be made possible too.

## infinite_world/
Really old test to try out an infinite world.
